### ifgame.html (ARCHIVED)


### History:
The very first website that I have created.
A mixtue of playing with features that I really wanted to add in, scrolling text, rotating images,
and function.

I was quite happy creating this, and stillgo back to have a laugh of what I did create.

I have always loved H2G2, and loved the concept of games that were textbased.

I never owned a computer that did not require the use of an emulator to play the z-machine games.


### Installing

The only software you will require to use this are:
 * A web browser that can use the `file://` path
 * java (web) to play both Adventure and H2G2 games
 * a media player (web) to play the embeded music files

### Copyright

As this was originally created for educational purposes and I have no idea what copyright was,

All images even though edited remain property of their original owners ( whoever they might be, google images).
All z-machine files remain property of their original owners.
All music files remain property of their original owners.
