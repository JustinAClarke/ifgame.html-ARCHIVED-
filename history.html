<h2>Z-Machine</h2>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <b>Z-machine</b> is a virtual machine that was developed by Joel Berez and Marc Blank in 1979 and used by Infocom for its text adventure games. Infocom compiled game code to files containing Z-machine instructions (called story files, or <b>Z-code</b> files), and could therefore port all its text adventures to a new platform simply by writing a Z-machine implementation for that platform. With the large number of incompatible home computer systems in use at the time, this was an important advantage over using native code (or developing some compiler for each system).</p>
<p>The "Z" of Z-machine stands for Zork, Infocom's first adventure game. Z-code files usually have names ending in .z1, .z2, .z3, .z4, .z5, .z6, .z7 or .z8, where the number is the version number of the Z-machine on which the file is intended to be run, as given by the first byte of the story file. This is a modern convention, however. Infocom itself used extensions of .dat (Data) and .zip (ZIP = Z-machine Interpreter Program), but the latter clashes with the present widespread use of .zip for PKZIP-compatible archive files (which did not exist during the time Infocom was active). Infocom produced six versions of the Z-machine. Files using versions 1 and 2 are very rare. Only two version 1 files are known to have been released by Infocom, and only two of version 2. Version 3 covers the vast majority of Infocom's released games. The later versions had more capabilities, culminating in some graphic support in version 6.</p>
<p>The compiler (called Zilch) which Infocom used to produce its story files, has never been released, although documentation of the language used (called <i>ZIL</i>, for Zork Implementation Language) still exists. In May 1993, Graham Nelson</a> released the first version of his Inform compiler, which also generates Z-machine story files as its output, even though the Inform source language is quite different from ZIL. Most files produced by Inform are version 5.</p>
<p>Inform has since become very popular in the interactive fiction community and, as a consequence, a large proportion of the interactive fiction now produced is in the form of Z-machine story files. Demand for the ability to create larger game files led Graham Nelson to specify versions 7 and 8 of the Z-machine, though version 7 is very rarely used. Because of the way addresses are handled, a version 3 story file can be up to 128K in length, a version 5 story can be up to 256K in length, and a version 8 story can be up to 512k in length. Though these sizes may seem small by today's computing standards, for text-only adventures, these are large enough for very elaborate games.</p>
<p>During the 1990s, Graham Nelson drew up a Z-machine standardbased on detailed studies of the existing Infocom files.</p><br>

      <p>There was a time when 
        computer games didn't have graphics. Or at least they couldn't have graphics 
        and sound at the same time. They certainly couldn't have graphics, sound 
        and enough content to keep even a human being amused for more than a few 
        minutes. So they had text. This was radical - a computer game you could 
        control by typing in commands. The game would then respond to your commands 
        with a breathtakingly prescient understanding of your intent. Or not. 
        Usually not - the early text parsers (circa 1977) weren't that bright. 
        But, as long as you limited yourself to what the game understood and the 
        game designers wrote creatively enough to misunderstand you in a humorous 
        and entertaining fashion, it all worked. It therefore stands to reason 
        that any game which combined a really good programmer with a really good 
        writer was likely to do well. So when Steve Meretzky of Infocom got together 
        with Douglas Adams to create a game based around the <a href="hhgg.html">Hitchhiker's Guide 
        to the Galaxy</a>, the result was never going to be less than interesting 
        and more than likely insane. So it proved - the Hitchhiker's Guide adventure 
        game was one of the best-selling games of its era, selling some 350,000 
        copies. In 1984.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then graphics games 
        came along and the computer using portion of the human race forgot all 
        about 500,000 years of language evolution and went straight back to the 
        electronic equivalent of banging rocks together - the point'n'click game. 
        Infocom and most of its competitors went to the wall - signaling the arrival 
        of the post-literate society. That's the way it's been for most of the 
        last dozen years.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Something strange 
        has now happened. The Net, and particularly e-mail, has become an integral 
        part of millions of lives. People have learned to type again and are taking 
        an interest in interacting, via their computers, with other people and 
        with content. At TDV, we've taken the basic need to create products with 
        wit, intelligence and humour and created <a href="http://www.starshiptitanic.com/">Starship Titanic</a>

        - the game that reinvented the art of conversation. Following many requests 
        from HHG fans and those sad people who still remember it, we're also re-releasing 
        the original game as shareware in three formats: Mac, PC and Java.<br>
<h2>Adventure</h2><br>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Around 1975, Will Crowther
	 wrote the first text adventure game, <a href="advent.html">Adventure</a> (originally called ADVENT because
	 a filename could only be six characters long in its operating system, and later
	 named Colossal Cave). It was programmed in Fortran for the PDP-10. Stanford University
	 graduate student Don Woods discovered Adventure while working at the Stanford Artificial
	 Intelligence Laboratory, and in 1977 obtained and expanded Crowther's source code (with
	 Crowther's permission). Crowther's original version was an accurate simulation of the real
	 Colossal Cave, but also included fantasy elements (such as axe-wielding dwarves and a
	 magic bridge); Woods's changes were reminiscent of the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien, and 
	included a troll, elves, and a volcano some claim is based on Mount Doom, but Woods says
	 was not.<br>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In early 1977, Adventure spread across
	 ARPAnet, and has survived on the Internet to this day. The game has since been ported to many other
	 operating systems, and was included with the floppy-disk distribution of Microsoft's MS-DOS 5.0 OS.
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The popularity of Adventure led to the wide
	 success of interactive fiction during the late 1970s and the 1980s, when home computers had little, if any,
 	graphics capability. Many elements of the original game have survived into the present, such as the command
	 'xyzzy', which is now included as an Easter Egg in games such as Minesweeper.
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Adventure was also directly responsible for the founding
 	of Sierra Online (later Sierra Entertainment); Ken and Roberta Williams played the game when it first appeared, and
	 when unable to find any other games of similar quality, decided to design one of their own.<br>
<h2>Interpreters</h2>
<p>Interpreters for Z-code files are available on a wide variety of platforms ? for example, on various old machines (such as the Apple II, TRS-80 and Sinclair), portable machines (such as Palm OS devices and the Nintendo Game Boy), and most modern platforms, showing that it is a very portable language.</p>
<p>Popular interpreters include Nitfol and Frotz. Nitfol makes use of the Glk API, and supports versions 1 through 8 of the Z-machine, including the version 6 graphical Z-machine. Save files are stored in the standard Quetzal save format. Binary files are currently available for several different operating systems, including Macintosh, Linux, MS-DOS, and Windows.</p>

<h3>Frotz</h3>
<p><b>Frotz</b> was originally written in C by Stefan Jokisch in 1995 for MS-DOS. Over time it was ported to a few other platforms, such as Unix, RiscOS, and Macintosh. Sound effects and graphics were supported to varying degrees. By 2002, development stalled and the program was picked up by David Griffith. The codebase was then distinctly split between the virtual machine and the user interface portions such that the virtual machine became entirely independent from any user interface. This allowed much more variety in porting Frotz. One of the stranger ports is also one of the simplest: an instant messenger bot is wrapped around a version of Frotz with the bare minimum of IO functionality creating a bot with which one can play most Z-machine games using an instant messenger client.</p>
